    <p>The Siberian Husky is a breed of medium-sized working sled dog.<br> The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family.<br> It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings,<br> and is smaller
 than the similar-looking Alaskan Malamute.<br>
Siberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where they are bred by the Chukchi people as well as the Koryak,<br> Yukaghir and Kamchadal people of Siberia for sled pulling and companionship.[2][4] It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced them to Nome, Alaska, during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs to work the mining fields and for expeditions through otherwise impassable terrain.[2] Today, the Siberian Husky is typically kept as a house pet,<br> though they are still frequently used as sled dogs by competitive and recreational mushers.[5</p> <button> purchase options</button>

    <p>Pit bull-type dogs have a controversial reputation as pets internationally, due to their history in dog fighting,<br>[10] the number of high-profile attacks documented in the media over decades, and their proclivity to latch on while biting.<br> Proponents of the type and advocates of regulation have engaged in a highly contentious nature-versus-nurture debate over whether aggressive tendencies in pit bulls may be appropriately attributed to owners' poor care for and competency to handle the dog or inherent qualities owing to their breeding for fighting purposes.[11] While some studies have argued that pit bull–type dogs are not disproportionately dangerous, offering competing interpretations on dog bite statistics, independent organizations have published statistics based on hospital records showing pit bulls are responsible for more than half of dog bite incidents among all breeds despite comprising only 6% of pet dogs.[12][13]:18,49 Some insurance companies will not cover pit bulls (along with Rottweilers and wolf hybrids) because these particular dogs cause a disproportionate rate of bite incidents.<br>[14] Dog bite severity varies by the breed of dog, and studies have found that pit bull-type dogs have both a high rate of reported bites and a high rate of severe injuries,<br> compared to other non-pit bull-type dogs.[15][16]</p> <button>purchase options</button>
