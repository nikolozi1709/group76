        <h1>bugatti chiron pur-sport</h1>
        <img id="vaxo" src="Bugatti-Chiron-Pur-Sport-main.jpg" width="500" lenght="500">
        <p> main carry over component from the Veyron is the 7,993 cc (8.0 L; 487.8 cu in) quad-turbocharged W16 engine,<br>
            though it is heavily updated. The engine in the Chiron has a peak power output of 1,103 kW (1,479 hp; 1,500<br>
            PS) at 6,700 rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm.[13] The engine in<br>
            the most powerful variant of its predecessor, the Veyron Super Sport generates 221 kW (296 hp; 300 PS) less<br>
            than the new Chiron, while the engine in the original Veyron generates 367 kW (492 hp; 499 PS) less<br>
            power.[14][15]

            Like its predecessor, the Veyron, the Chiron utilises a carbon fibre body structure, independent suspension<br>
            and a Haldex All-wheel drive system.[16][17][18] The carbon fibre body has a stiffness of 50,000 Nm per<br>
            degree.[19]<br>

            The Chiron can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer, 0–200<br>
            km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.5 seconds and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.6 seconds. In a world-record-setting test<br>
            at the time in 2017, the Chiron reached 400 km/h (249 mph) in 32.6 seconds, after which it needed 9.4<br>
            seconds to brake to standstill.[20]<br>

            The Chiron's top speed is electronically limited to 420 km/h (261 mph), or 375–380 km/h (233–236 mph)<br>
            without the specific key, for safety reasons, mainly arising from the tyres as Bugatti concluded that no<br>
            tyre currently manufactured would be able to handle the stress at the top speed the Chiron is capable of<br>
            achieving.[2][21] Independent testing by an owner has indicated that the Chiron can easily attain its<br>
            limited top speed.[22] Mixed fuel consumption is 22.5 L/100 km (12.55 mpg‑imp; 10.45 mpg‑US).[23]<br>

        <p>Koenigsegg Automotive AB (Swedish: [ˈkø̌ːnɪɡsɛɡ] ⓘ) is a Swedish high-performance automobile manufacturer
            founded in 1994 by automotive engineer Christian von Koenigsegg.
            Headquartered in Ängelholm, the company is renowned for producing ultra-exclusive “megacars,”<br>
            handcrafted in small numbers and pushed to the limits of automotive technology.<br>
            Koenigsegg made its production debut with the CC8S in 2002, notable for introducing its signature dihedral<br>
            synchro-helix actuation doors.
            Since then, models like the Agera, Regera, Jesko, and Gemera have earned global acclaim for record-setting<br>
            performance, hybrid innovation,
            and bespoke engineering. As of late 2023, the company employs just under 800 people and remains fully<br>
            independent,
            following the repurchase of a previously sold 20 percent stake.</p>
