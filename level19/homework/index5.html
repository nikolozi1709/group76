The BRABUS ROCKET 900 "ONE OF TEN" is a limited edition of ten vehicles being produced based on the Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S 4MATIC+ (4-Door Coupé).
The heart of this BRABUS automobile is the new BRABUS ROCKET 900 V8 biturbo displacement engine, which,
thanks to the expansion to 4.4 liters and a newly developed high-performance charging system, achieves a peak output of 662 kW / 900 PS.
The maximum torque is 1,250 Nm, but is limited to 1,050 Nm in the vehicle.
In combination with the SPEEDSHIFT MCT 9-speed sports transmission and all-wheel drive, the four-seater coupé catapults itself from standstill to 100 km/h in 2.8 seconds.
300 km/h is reached in 23.9 seconds. The top speed is electronically limited to 330 km/h due to the tires.
In order to optimally bring the enormous power of the new BRABUS displacement engine to the road,
the BRABUS ROCKET 900 "ONE OF TEN" is equipped with wide monoblock Z wheels measuring 21 inches on the front axle and 22 inches in diameter on the rear axle. To make room for it,
the designers developed a styled carbon wide version and in line with this, aerodynamic components were created in the wind tunnel that produce higher downforce and thus increase driving stability at high speeds.</p>
